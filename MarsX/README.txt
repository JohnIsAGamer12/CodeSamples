In May 2024, as part of our Graphics/ECS API Portfolio Project class, I was put into a group of 4 Classmates where I played the role of a Gameplay Programmer, and utilized my C++ Skills while also learning a ECS aka flecs as we were given a Base Code to start off with this project. I've developed Majority of the Core Gameplay Mechanics like Rewriting the Player, The Base Functionality of the Enemies, Physics, & Enemy Spawning. I did added one new feature to the base code which was the PowerUp Pickups, and the Pickup Spawner. We did had a lot of ideas for this game, but during that month, Full Sail was hosting a Big Event they do call Hall of Fame that a lot of us became distracted from this event. But we've became self aware and got things back on the horse, by cutting a lot of Mechanics that I thought was cool but due to the three week time that we had it just wasn't enough time. With that being said, I hope my samples proof my valor to your company and it's values.
